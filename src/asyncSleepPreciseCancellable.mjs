/**
 * Waits a given amount of time.
 *
 * This function returns both a promise and cancel function in order to cancel the
 * wait time if necessary. If cancelled, the promise will be rejected with a `CancelledError`.
 *
 * This function is similar to `asyncSleep()` except it ensures that the amount of time measured
 * using the `Date` object is always greater than or equal the asked amount of time.
 *
 * This function can imply additional delay that can be bad for performances. As such it is
 * recommended to only use it in unit tests or very specific cases. Most applications should
 * be adapted to work with the usual `setTimout()` inconsistencies even if it can trigger some
 * milliseconds before the asked delay.
 *
 * @param {number} amount An amount of time in milliseconds
 * @returns {Array} A tuple of two objects:
 *   * `promise`: The promise
 *   * `cancel`: The cancel function. It will return a boolean that will be `true` if the promise was effectively cancelled,
 *     `false` otherwise.
 * @example
 * import { asyncSleepPreciseCancellable } from 'modern-async'
 *
 * const [promise, cancel] = asyncSleepPreciseCancellable(100) // schedule to resolve the promise after 100ms
 *
 * cancel()
 *
 * try {
 *   await promise
 * } catch (e) {
 *   console.log(e.name) // prints CancelledError
 * }

/**
 * A class representing a queue.
 *
 * Tasks added to the queue are processed in parallel (up to the concurrency limit).
 * If all slots of the queue are occupied, the task is queued until one becomes available.
 * When a slot is freed, the pending task with higher priority is executed. If multiple pending tasks have the same
 * priority the first that was scheduled is executed.
 *
 * Once a task is completed, its corresponding promise is terminated accordingly.
 *
 * @example
 * import { Queue, asyncSleep } from 'modern-async'
 *
 * const queue = new Queue(3) // create a queue with concurrency 3
 *
 * const array = Array.from(Array(100).keys()) // an array of 100 numbers from 0 to 99
 *
 * const promises = []
 * for (const i of array) {
 *   promises.push(queue.exec(async () => {
 *     console.log(`Starting task ${i}`)
 *     await asyncSleep(Math.random() * 10) // waits a random amount of time between 0ms and 10ms
 *     console.log(`Ending task ${i}`)
 *     return i;
 *   }))
 * }
 * const results = await Promise.all(promises)
 * // all the scheduled tasks will perform with a maximum concurrency of 3 and log when they start and stop
 *
 * console.log(results) // will display an array with the result of the execution of each separate task

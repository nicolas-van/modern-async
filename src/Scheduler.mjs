/**
 * A class implementing a scheduler.
 *
 * It fills the same purpose than setInterval() but its behavior is more adapted to asynchronous
 * tasks. Notably it can limit the concurrency of asynchronous tasks running in parallel.
 *
 * @example
 * import { Scheduler, asyncSleep } from 'modern-async'
 *
 * let i = 0
 * const scheduler = new Scheduler(async () => {
 *   const taskNbr = i
 *   i += 1
 *   console.log(`Starting task ${taskNbr}`)
 *   await asyncSleep(10) // waits 10ms
 *   console.log(`Ending task ${taskNbr}`)
 * }, 100) // a scheduler that triggers every 100ms
 * // the default configuration uses a maximum concurrency of 1 and doesn't allow pending
 * // tasks, which mean that if a task takes more time to complete than the delay it will be skipped
 *
 * scheduler.start() // starts the scheduler
 *
 * await asyncSleep(1000) // waits 1s, during that time the task should trigger ~ 9 times
 *
 * scheduler.stop() // stops the scheduler
 * console.log('Scheduler stopped')
 * // no "Starting task" console message may appear from here but you could still see a
 * // "Stopping task" as there could have a task that started before we stopped the
 * // scheduler
 */

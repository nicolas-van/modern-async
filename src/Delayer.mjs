/**
 * A class used to spread time or cpu intensive operations on multiple tasks in the event loop in order
 * to avoid blocking other tasks that may need to be executed.
 *
 * It is configured with a trigger time, which represents the maximum amount of time your tasks should
 * monopolize the event loop. Choosing an appropriate trigger time is both important and hard. If too low
 * it will impact the performances of your long running algorithm. If too high it will impact the other
 * tasks that need to run in the event loop.
 *
 * When using Delayer your code should contain frequent calls to `await delayer.checkDelay()`, usually
 * at the end of every loop. `checkDelay()` will check the amount of time that ellasped since the last time
 * it triggered a new task in the event loop. If the amount of time is below the trigger time it returns
 * an already resolved promise and the remaining computation will be able to continue processing in a
 * microtask. If not it will call the `asyncDelay()` function that will retrigger the operation in a later task
 * of the event loop.
 *
 * @example
 * import { Delayer } from 'modern-async'
 *
 * const delayer = new Delayer(10) // a delayer with 10ms trigger time
 *
 * // some cpu intensive operation that will run for a long time
 * for (let i = 0; i < 100000000; i += 1) {
 *   // some code
 *   await delayer.checkDelay()
 * }
